The goal is to setup a ITS station emulator.

To achieve this, we run multiple instances of an ITS stack, each in a
different network namespace.



An ITS stack is currenctly defined as:

 - itsnet
 - mwtun
 - mw-server
 - gpsd

Each ITS stack runs in a network namespace named:
 - envX

For each instance, two veth pairs are created:
 - vtxX <-> veth0
 - ctlX <-> ctl0

The different vtxX devices are bridged together.


There are various components/configurations needed to achieve a workable
setup:
 - bridge configuration: done in /etc/network/interfaces
 - netns setup: done via a systemd unit.
 - itsnet: is started via systemd unit (w/ ExecStart=/sbin/ip netns exec %i itsnet...)
 - mwtun: is started via systemd unit (w/ ExecStart=/sbin/ip netns exec %i mwtun...)
 - gps: started via systemd unit (w/ ExecStart=/sbin/ip netns exec %i gpsfake...)
   Using gpsd to connect to another gpsd device requires setting up IP routing.

 - mw-server: is started via systemd unit (w/ ExecStart=/sbin/ip netns exec %i mw-server...)

Configuration of itsnet
 - Copy the file installed by the cargeo6 package in /usr/share/doc
 - Adjust parameters
